# ðŸŒ¸ garden mathematics ðŸŒ¼

### description

Revisit math but without the equations, in place of the traditional notation build a more personal language for expressing things like algorithmic thinking, affine transforms, and recursion, using various approaches: conversation, in code, hands on constructions. By re-thinking our heavy reliance on traditional notation we offer the potential for a radical new way of understanding math. In this class we especially highlight ways math is represented in code.

the course title references how a lot of this material is observable in the natural world, like in plants; this class could be an outdoor class.

### material

(30 min) introduction, algorithms by hand, unlearning number bases

history

for the moment, forget what you know. forget counting individual units... think about ratios

- discussion: what is computation to a finite state machine? *source: Church-Turing thesis*
- exercise: draw a voronoi. folding voronoi. origami axiom 2. *source: [voronoi](http://orderinspace.blogspot.com/2015/07/voronoi.html), [axioms](https://rabbitear.org/examples/axioms/)*
- observations: algorithmic thinking. before expressing an algorithm in code, make it with your hands.

(30 min) functions

- functions as inputs (x) and outputs (y): logarithms. sine.
- functions in math and code notation. *source: [math as code](https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code)*
- exercise: p5 sine sketch

(1 hour) recursion

- (1) fold and (2) draw a dragon fractal *source [fold a dragon curve](https://www.cutoutfoldup.com/216-dragon-curve.php), [9 iteration dragon curve](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlUirtdno1b/)*
- observations: the feeling of holding self-similar parts inside your head, the part contains the whole.
- l-systems: reverse engineer l-systems, describing plant growth patterns. *source: Godel Escher Bach*
   - radial branching angle
   - branch sprout locations
   - spiral packing
- python and language tokens, grammars *source: [Recursion and Context-Free Grammars](https://www.decontextualize.com/teaching/rwet/recursion-and-context-free-grammars/)*
- additional material: strings, knots, origami
- exercise: p5 l-system branching plant

(45 minutes) linear algebra

- orientation matrices demo. open in phone (Chrome): `https://robbykraft.com/orientation/`
- demo why matrices are useful
- discussion: matrices as a change of basis. *source: [3 blue 1 brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE)*
- code an SVG shadow by changing the matrix: `<circle r="100" transform="matrix(1 0 0 1 200 200)" />`
