### description

Revisit math but without any formulas. In place of traditional mathematics notation build a more personal language for expressing things like algorithmic thinking, affine transforms, and recursion. This class visits these concepts in various ways: conversational, with hands-on crafts, and in code. Where once it was standard to describe math using traditional mathematics notation it's now possible to describe the same math as accurately and completely by using code, potentially reaching an increasingly-larger audience.

the course title references how most of this material is observable in the natural world, plants especially; it wouldn't hurt to hold class outdoors.

### material

(30 min) introduction, algorithms by hand

- discussion: what is computation to a finite state machine? *source: Church-Turing thesis*
- exercise: draw a voronoi
- observations: algorithmic thinking. before expressing an algorithm in code, execute it with your hands.
- folding voronoi. origami axiom 2.

(30 minutes) functions

- math notation vs. computer function
- graphs are only 1 kind of visualization (and are 2D because a function is 1D)

(1 hour) recursion

- (1) fold and (2) draw a dragon fractal
- observations: the feeling of holding self-similar parts inside your head
- additional material: strings, knots, origami
- l-systems: reverse engineer l-systems by describing plant patterns and growth
   - radial branching angle
   - branch sprout locations
   - spiral packing
- python and language tokens, grammars

> computers optional: code a branching plant

(45 minutes) linear algebra

- orientation matrices demo. open in phone (Chrome): `https://robbykraft.com/orientation/`
- discussion: matrices as a change of basis. *source: [3 blue 1 brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE)*
- code an SVG shadow by changing the matrix: `<circle r="100" transform="matrix(1 0 0 1 200 200)" />`
