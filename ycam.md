# ðŸŒ¸ garden mathematics ðŸŒ¼

revisit high-school and college level math without any formulas, rather a visual and sensory exploration with a focus on things especially relevant to coding and computers like natural processes, recursion, and linear algebra.

# introduction, algorithms by hand

what is computation to a finite state machine? Church-Turing.

## Voronoi

draw a voronoi

> be precise, use tools (invent tools), you can stare into it and get lost if it's next-level precise

observations: algorithmic thinking. before expressing an algorithm in code, execute it with your hands.

# recursion

## recursion hand-crafts

1. fold a dragon fractal
2. draw a dragon fractal

observations: the feeling of holding self-similar parts inside your head.

## strings, knots, origami

## l-systems

reverse engineer l-systems by describing plant patterns and growth.

- radial branching angle
- branch sprout locations
- spiral packing

python and language tokens, grammars

Discussion: matrices as a change of basis

code an SVG shadow by changing the matrix:

`<circle cx="200" cy="200" r="100" transform="matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0)" />`

rather

`<circle r="100" transform="matrix(1 0 0 1 200 200)" />`
