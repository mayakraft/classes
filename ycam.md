# linear transformations

**conversation**

linear transformation matrices as a change of basis vectors

source material [three blue one brown, linear algebra, chapter 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE)

**exercise**

here is a circle in svg, transformed by a matrix (no transform)

```
<circle cx="0" cy="0" r="100" transform="matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0)" />
```

by changing the numbers in the matrix make a second circle be a shadow cast on the ground (squashed and skewed).

**recap**

in modern computing vectors are being used to represent qualitative attributes.

# data as interpretable format

like sheet music

# log scale

**exercise**

using [NASA data](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/), draw the planets all in a line, at their correct distance from the sun.

```c
log(input)
```

run the distances through a log function, and redraw.

audio synthesis. overtones.

math functions beyond their typical use. sine, cosine.

**exercise**

# math with your hands

fold a strip of paper over itself to make the fibonacci sequence =~ the golden ratio.

fold a strip of paper over itself to make a dragon fractal. folding a recursive function.
