# ðŸŒ¸ garden mathematics ðŸŒ¼

this class is a part of [SFPC at YCAM 2019](https://www.ycam.jp/events/2019/sfpc/).

This course aims to revisit mathematics, not introduce new math but in place of the traditional methods build a more personal language for expressing play, algorithmic thinking, and recursion. By re-thinking our heavy reliance on traditional notation we offer the potential for a radical new way of understanding math. In this class we especially highlight ways math is explored in origami, crafts, and code.

> "In many classrooms, students are not permitted to construct a personal understanding of the mathematics that is presented. The values, traditions, beliefs, language, and habits reflective of the culture of the students are ignored. In such situations, the ways that children might invent personally meaningful conceptualizations are not respected."

# material

## 1. origami puzzles

*materials: square origami paper (some puzzles might require A4 paper)*

the puzzles selected here don't require that the students have any experience in origami. the effect of this lesson is to experience measurement using the medium itself.

## 2. origami foundations

*materials: square origami paper*

### A. origami axioms

every origami maneuver can be expressed by one of seven axioms. we will perform a folding sequence that creases one line for every one of the seven axioms.

### B. Maekawa-gami

an introduction to origami design would be a weeks-long course in itself. this exercise introduces one core concept: sticking to the Maekawa-gami 22.5Â° grid. students will squash a simple swivel fold and are asked to look for the 22.5Â° solutions.

## 3. two stories about numbers

### A. number bases

This section explores ethnomathematics and the evolution of counting. Why does 1/3 look terrible as a decimal but 1/4 looks okay? The history (and persistence) of non-western counting systems, the introduction of zero, observations of our own number system, number morphs, cyclic patterns, and operative patterns.

### B. logarithmic thinking and identity values

"what number is halfway to 9?" we discuss the work of Stanislas Dehaene how Logarithmic thinking is innate and unlearned. This conversation includes the logarithmic nature of human senses, audio and visual, and noise and compression, JPEG compression, the mathematical relationship between musical pitches. This section concludes with "identity values" (0 addition, 1 multiplication), and how we use numbers just nearby (1.01) as a form of play.

## 4. coding time #1

*materials: one laptop, no software required except for a web browser*

functions as graphs and code blocks: In this section we relate the traditional way learning functions in math class by graphing them to playing with them in code.

coding exercise 1: make an airplane hover mid-screen, with a slight up-down-up-down motion.
coding exercise 2: how do you make an arrow always point toward your mouse?

## 5. algorithms by hand

The Voronoi algorithm and origami axiom 2: we will learn to draw a Voronoi graph by hand, assisted by origami axiom 2 (fold a point to a point, or, crease a line that is the perpendicular bisector)

Our final computing concept is recursion, to define a concept in terms of itself. We begin by first drawing then folding a dragon curve. We explore recursion in the garden, plant branching and nesting, L-systems as a approximation of plant structures, and wrap up with nested structures in language, grammars, language tokens.
