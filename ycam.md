### description

revisit math without any formulas; in place of traditional mathematics notation build a more personal language for expressing things like algorithmic thinking, affine transforms, and recursion. This class visits these concepts in various ways: conversational, hands-on crafts, and in code. Where once it was standard to describe math using traditional mathematics notation, it's now possible to describe math as equally and completely by using code, and has the opportunity to reach an increasingly-larger audience.

### material

(30 min) introduction, algorithms by hand

- discussion: what is computation to a finite state machine? *source: Church-Turing thesis*
- exercise: draw a voronoi
- observations: algorithmic thinking. before expressing an algorithm in code, execute it with your hands.
- folding voronoi. origami axiom 2.

(1 hour) recursion

- (1) fold and (2) draw a dragon fractal
- observations: the feeling of holding self-similar parts inside your head
- additional material: strings, knots, origami
- l-systems: reverse engineer l-systems by describing plant patterns and growth
   - radial branching angle
   - branch sprout locations
   - spiral packing
- python and language tokens, grammars

> computers optional: code a branching plant

(45 minutes) linear algebra

- orientation matrices demo. open in phone (Chrome): `https://robbykraft.com/orientation/`
- discussion: matrices as a change of basis. *source: [3 blue 1 brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE)*
- code an SVG shadow by changing the matrix: `<circle r="100" transform="matrix(1 0 0 1 200 200)" />`

> everyone is together for the first half (or 2/3rds). in the second part, students split off into 2 or 3 groups, to focus on what excited them most. the class splits, but each group still works together.

- first 30 minutes: introduction
- hour 1: recursion
