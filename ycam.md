- # garden mathematics

  this is a re-visiting of math without any formulas rather visual and sensory explorations, with a focus on things like natural processes/fractals and linear algebra/matrices because of their relevancy to coding and computers.

  ðŸŒ¸ if possible, hold this class outside among plants. there is an opportunity to use them as sources during discussion. ðŸŒ¼

  > everyone is together for the first half, it's fast paced and touches briefly on a few things. the second half students can choose what they want to focus on from 2 categories. class splits, but each group still works together.

  ## recursion: fold a dragon fractal, hand draw fractals

  observations: the feeling of holding self-similar parts inside your head.

  ## hand-drawing voronoi

  > (be precise, use tools, you can stare into it and get lost if it's next-level precise)

  folding voronoi. origami axiom 2.

  ## strings, knots, origami

  ## l-systems

  python and language tokens, grammars

  plant patterns and growth.

  code a branching plant

  write an L-system formula on a strip of paper

  ## logarithmic scale

  ## linear algebra

  Discussion: matrices as a change of basis

  source:  [3 blue 1 brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE)

  code an SVG shadow by changing the matrix:

  `<circle cx="0" cy="0" r="100" transform="matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0)" />`
